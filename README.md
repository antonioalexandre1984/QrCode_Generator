# John Virtual Card

John Virtual Card is a design of a virtual card for John Doe, a fictional character who is used to test the John Company's identification system.

# introduction

João is tired of using business cards for his business. He liked having a picture on
his phone so that people scanning it could see all their data on one page.

## ⚙️ About the tests

About the tests we perform unit tests as described below.

* The first test, "should update name and validation state when invalid input is provided", checks whether the component updates the validation state of the name when invalid input is provided. The provided context has the isNameValid state set to false, simulating an invalid input, and it is expected that when the user enters "john" in the name field, the component updates the name state to "john" and displays the error message "Please enter a valid name".

* The second test, "should update Github user and validation state when invalid input is provided", checks whether the component updates the validation state of the Github user when invalid input is provided. The provided context has the isGithubValid state set to false, simulating an invalid input, and it is expected that when the user enters "john" in the Github user field, the component updates the Github user state to "john" and displays the error message "Please enter a valid Github username".

* The third test, "should update Linkedin user and validation state when valid input is provided", checks whether the component updates the validation state of the Linkedin user when valid input is provided. The provided context has the isLinkedinValid state set to false, simulating a valid input, and it is expected that when the user enters "john" in the Linkedin user field, the component updates the Linkedin user state to "john" and does not display the error message "Please enter a valid Linkedin username".
